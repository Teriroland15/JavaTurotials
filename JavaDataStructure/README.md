# Data Structure in Java

## Problem-1
: Stack is an abstract data type that follows LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. Implement a Stack data type in Java that can store any data of user choice and throws exception if a user tres to retrieve data when it is empty ( no element at all) or if a user tries to push data when it has already  reached at its maximum capacity.

### Solution

 One implementation of this problem is shown [here](https://github.com/azizurice/JavaTutorials/tree/master/JavaDataStructure/src/com/letscodes/ds/stack) and unit test is show [here](https://github.com/azizurice/JavaTutorials/tree/master/JavaDataStructure/test/com/letscodes/ds/stack).
