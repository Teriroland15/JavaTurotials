# JavaDesignPatterns

[Problem-1](https://github.com/azizurice/JavaTutorials/tree/master/JavaDesignPatterns/src/com/letscodes/dp/creational/singleton) : Write a class that will satisfy the singleton design patten. What if the environment is multi-threaded. Finally, write a SingletonDemo program that will use the singleton class and shows that multiple instances have not been created.

[Problem-3 : Observer Pattern](https://github.com/azizurice/JavaTutorials/tree/master/JavaDesignPatterns/src/com/letscodes/dp/behavioral/Company) : Observer Pattern is another very important design pattern. It has many practical use cases in software development. Here is an use case. Suppose we have a company which has three different type of clients, such as AndroidClient, WebClient, and iOSClient. All these clients consume the Company's APIs. They want to be notified whenever the company update its APIs. 

Based on the situation discussed above, the CompanyAPIs would be subject and all the client are observers. Write a demo application following Observer Design Pattern principle from the scratch which notifies all the clients whenever the company's APIs would be updated.
