# JavaTutorials

This is a simple repository consisting of different examples. These examples are classified based on the level of understanding Java. Hope, it will help the beginners to learn Java, intermediate learners to excel/enhance his/her understanding and advanced learners to recap his/her own experience (a place to enhance making use of Java together for Advanced Java Programmers).

** Organization:

This repository is a tutorial for learning Java from the very beginning to the advanced level Java. At the very beginning, we have divided the Java learning process
into five different projects.

1. [JavaBasic](https://github.com/azizurice/JavaTutorials/tree/master/JavaBasic) - here we will include very basic Java programs and introduce very essential JDK classes which will help the beginners to get into the Java world.

2. [JavaIntermediate](https://github.com/azizurice/JavaTutorials/tree/master/JavaIntermediate) - here we will include features that will require the JavaBasic skills.

3. [JavaAlgorithms](https://github.com/azizurice/JavaTutorials/tree/master/JavaAlgorithms) -- here we will discuss different algorithms implemented in Java.

4. [JavaAdvanced](https://github.com/azizurice/JavaTutorials/tree/master/JavaAdvanced)  -- here we will add the number of different advanced feature, a Java professional needs/uses.

5. [JavaDesignPatterns](https://github.com/azizurice/JavaTutorials/tree/master/JavaAdvanced) --here we will discuss different design patterns in Java, software engineers use in the industry.

In this project, I didn't use any 3rd part library for consuming restful web service like RETROFIT, nor did I use any build tools like Maven or Gradle here. There are many 3rd party libraries which make our life easy with little bit effort at the beginning.
But raw solution always good for understanding.
